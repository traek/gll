# GLL - Gospel Library Linker
The goal of GLL will be to generate URLs for scriptural and eventually other reference material for use with the Gospel Library app and website published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Version 1 will be a simple Chrome plugin which will output a URL.
